I found the current implementations of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms are somewhat complicated, which is hard to get start.

Here are some classical Reinforcement Learning Algorithms implemented by Pytorch. I tried to make them **clean, robust, and unified**, hoping to help you get start with RL quickly.

Now I have finished **Q-learning, DQN, DDQN, PPO discrete, PPO continuous, TD3, SAC Continuous, SAC Discrete**. I will implement more in the future.
